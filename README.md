# Project 7 - Interactive Video Player

## Project overview
This was another fun project to work on. In the project you use the mediaElement.js plugin for the video player and then either javaScript or jQuery to interact with the video and on page elements.

In this project I focussed on using vanilla javaScript to me get a better understanding of it.
